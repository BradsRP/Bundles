Message_0_Page_1 <color=#FFFFFF><b>While being inside a named location (such as Ravenport), you may not holster or carry any firearm except pistols. If you are caught doing so, your firearm would be confiscated and you'd be arrested and fined.</b></color>
Message_0_Page_2 <color=#FFFFFF><b>If you intend to carry and/or use a firearm, always make sure to have your gun license with you. If you are caught in possession of a firearm and you don't have your license, your firearms will get confiscated and you'd be arrested and fined.</b></color>
Message_0_Page_3 <color=#FFFFFF><b>Certain types of firearms and ammunition are illegal inside this county. If you are caught having either of these, they will get confiscated and you'd be arrested and fined.</b></color>
Message_0_Page_4 <color=#FFFFFF><b>Never forget to leave your weapon on safety! While it is not a law to keep it on safety, it is good practice as you will break a law if you illegally discharge your firearm. Doing so will result in your firearm being confiscated and you'd be arrested and fined.</b></color>
Message_0_Page_5 <color=#FFFFFF><b>This is the end of your lesson. You will now be handed the written test. Take your time and good luck!</b></color>
