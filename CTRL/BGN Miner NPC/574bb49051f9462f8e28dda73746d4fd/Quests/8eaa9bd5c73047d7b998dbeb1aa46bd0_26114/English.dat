Name <color=#0047AB><b>Mining Forward IV</b></color>
Description I'm guessing you are sick of this gray colour? Same here. Complete the tasks below and you'll finally move on to the <color=#0047AB><b>Cobalt Mine</b></color> and unlock the <color=#0047AB><b>Upgrades V</b></color> quest. You're approaching a radioactive region now, I'll give you one of my spare gasmasks and a filter too.
