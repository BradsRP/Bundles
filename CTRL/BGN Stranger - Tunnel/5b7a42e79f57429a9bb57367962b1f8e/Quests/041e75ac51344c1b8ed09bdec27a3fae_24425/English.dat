Description Thanks for brining me the HMG. I made sure to put in a good word to the Trinket Collector. You are starting to make a name for yourself around here and Rupert (Legal Gun Dealer) was asking about you. If you bring me the following list of items, I will see if I can access his special "buyback" section. No promises though.
