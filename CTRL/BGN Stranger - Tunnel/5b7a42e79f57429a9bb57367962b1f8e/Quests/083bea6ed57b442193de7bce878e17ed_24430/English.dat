Description Thank you, with this navigation system we can finally get the coordinates of the DMZ Level 3. However be careful, we don't know what we'll encounter and our tools are telling us that there are high levels of radiation. I gave you a gaskmask and a filter, you can buy some more later from me if you need. From what we can see from a distance though, there are a few buildings located in the area. Head over there and see if you can find any radio logs or anything that may be useful to us.
