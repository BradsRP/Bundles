Description Pete asked me to thank you, those electronic parts and the compontents really helped out in his workshop. He is more than happy to buy stuff from you in the future. Whenever you get bored of the DMZ Level 2, head over to the bridge of the decommissioned aircraft carrier and collect the navigation system. If you bring it back to me, I'll get you into the DMZ Level 3. Good luck!
