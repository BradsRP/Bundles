Description I'll make sure to give this salvage to Betty and let her know it was from you. In the meantime, the wrecked vehicles in the DMZ Level 2 have some electronic parts and valuable components left over. Bring these back to me and I'll ask Pete (Hardware) if you can sell him some parts in the future for some extra cash.
