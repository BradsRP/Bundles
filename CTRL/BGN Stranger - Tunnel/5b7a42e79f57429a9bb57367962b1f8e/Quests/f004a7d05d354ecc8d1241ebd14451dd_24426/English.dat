Name <color=#ffffff><b>Getting To Know You</b></color>
Description Thanks for brining me the items, Rupert was very impressed to hear about this new prodigy in town and was more than happy to help you out on your journey. Now that I know I can fully trust you, we can talk more important matters. One of the military mutants in the DMZ Level 1 has some important documents which we need. We call him "The Sarge". Due to a series of mutations over long periods of time, this mutant has lots of health and deals lots of damage. Don't let his size fool you, you'll need an army to take him down. Bring me these documents and I'll give you access to the DMZ Level 2.
