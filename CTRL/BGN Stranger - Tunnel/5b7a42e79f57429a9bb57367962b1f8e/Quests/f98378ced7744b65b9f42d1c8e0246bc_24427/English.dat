Description Wow, these documents are actually more important than I thought to begin with, thank you! I will make sure to clear the access to the DMZ Level 2. If you do go over there, head over to the ship yard and bring me back some salvage. Junkyard Betty has been needing some. If you get this for her, she will let you use her shop.
